## Introduction
Welcome to the **Radicals Lunar Exploration Project**, developed for the [Bharatiya Antariksh Hackathon 2024](https://isro.hack2skill.com/2024/). Our mission is to explore the lunar South Pole using advanced image processing, crater and boulder detection, and pathfinding algorithms. With the help of cutting-edge technologies such as **YOLOv5** and the **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** system, we aim to assist future moon missions in optimizing traversal routes while avoiding obstacles.

## Features
- üåë **Georeferenced OHRC Imagery**: Reprojects Orbiter High-Resolution Camera (OHRC) images for better precision.
- üü° **Crater & Boulder Detection**: Parallel processing through **YOLOv5** and traditional computer vision techniques like Hough Transforms.
- üêú **Ant Colony Optimization**: Innovative ACO-based pathfinding to traverse lunar surfaces efficiently, avoiding craters and boulders.
- üõ∞Ô∏è **Simulated Rover Path Visualization**: Pathfinding and rover movement simulation using **Unity3D** on Digital Terrain Model (DTM) data.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Used for georeferencing, detection, and pathfinding.
- **GDAL**: For georeferencing OHRC images.
- **YOLOv5**: For crater and boulder detection.
- **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**: To optimize pathfinding.
- **Unity3D**: Simulating rover movement on the lunar surface.
- **QGIS**: For terrain data extraction.

## Usage

### Georeferencing & Image Calibration
1. OHRC images are **georeferenced** using **GDAL** and reprojected to the **Lunar South Polar Stereographic CRS**. The calibrated images are clipped to focus on landing sites.
2. After preprocessing (normalization, denoising), images are fed into **two parallel detection pipelines**: YOLOv5 and traditional computer vision methods.

### Crater & Boulder Detection
We implemented **two approaches** for detection:
- **Approach A**: Parallel processing using YOLOv5 and traditional methods (Hough Transform, Blob Detection).
- **Approach B**: Separate YOLOv5 and traditional CV models for flexibility between accuracy and speed.

---

## Scientific Stops
During the mission, we have a total of **10 scientific stops**, with significant analysis at each stop:
1. **Initial Landing Site Characterization** at coordinates 85.36161¬∞ S, 31.41594¬∞ E.
2. **Surface Composition**: 85.36162¬∞ S, 31.41252¬∞ E.
3. **Navigation & Mobility Test Site**.

## Pathfinding: Ant Colony Optimization
Our ACO algorithm optimizes the rover's path by avoiding obstacles like craters and boulders. The process involves pheromone-based pathfinding:
- Ants search for food and return to the colony, leaving pheromone trails that guide others. We simulate this behavior in **ACS** to identify optimal rover paths.

### Pathfinding Parameters:
- **Distance**: Changes based on elevation.
- **Speed**: Adjusted based on terrain steepness.
- **Heuristic Value**: Dynamically adjusted for optimal path calculation.

---

## Visualization
We used **Unity3D** to simulate the rover's movements based on the optimized traversal path. The rover starts at the **Landing Site** and navigates through the 10 scientific stops on the lunar surface.

#### Simulation Steps:
1. Extract terrain mesh using QGIS from DTM/DEM data.
2. Import the mesh into Unity.
3. Load the optimal path from the ACO results into the Unity script.
4. Simulate rover traversal across 10 scientific stops.
